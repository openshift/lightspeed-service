    query: what is kubernetes?
    expected_response: Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration tool developed
      by Google. It allows you to run and manage container-based workloads, and is
      commonly used to deploy interconnected microservices in a cloud-native way.
      Kubernetes clusters can span hosts across various environments, including on-premise,
      public, private, and hybrid clouds. It provides features such as sharing resources,
      orchestrating containers across multiple hosts, installing new hardware configurations,
      running health checks and self-healing applications, and scaling containerized
      applications.

    query: what is openshift virtualization?
    expected_response: OpenShift Virtualization is an add-on to Red Hat OpenShift
      Container Platform that allows you to run and manage virtual machine workloads
      alongside container workloads. It adds new objects into your OpenShift cluster
      using Kubernetes custom resources to enable virtualization tasks such as creating
      and managing Linux and Windows virtual machines, running pod and VM workloads
      together in a cluster, connecting to virtual machines through consoles and CLI
      tools, importing and cloning existing VMs, managing network interface controllers
      and storage disks attached to VMs, and live migrating VMs between nodes. It
      also provides an enhanced web console for managing these virtualized resources
      alongside the OpenShift cluster containers and infrastructure.

    query: What is the purpose of the imagePullPolicy in Red Hat OpenShift Container
      Platform?
    expected_response: 'The imagePullPolicy in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
      determines whether a container image should be pulled before starting the container.
      It has three possible values: Always, IfNotPresent, and Never.


      If a container imagePullPolicy parameter is not specified, Red Hat OpenShift
      Container Platform sets it based on the image tag. If the tag is "latest", it
      defaults imagePullPolicy to "Always". Otherwise, it defaults imagePullPolicy
      to "IfNotPresent".


      The "Always" value ensures that the container image is always pulled before
      starting the container. The "IfNotPresent" value ensures that the container
      image is only pulled if it does not already exist in the container registry.
      The "Never" value ensures that the container image is never pulled, and the
      container will use the cached image if available.


      In summary, the imagePullPolicy is used to control the behavior of container
      image pulling in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, allowing for efficient
      resource utilization and reduced latency.'

    query: How does Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines automate deployments?
    expected_response: Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines automates deployments by using
      Tekton building blocks to abstract away the underlying implementation details.
      It introduces standard custom resource definitions (CRDs) for defining CI/CD
      pipelines that are portable across Kubernetes distributions. These pipelines
      are serverless, cloud-native, continuous integration, and continuous deployment
      systems that run in isolated containers. They use standard Tekton custom resources
      to automate deployments and are designed for decentralized teams working on
      microservices-based architecture.

    query: what is a limitrange?
    expected_response: 'A LimitRange is a feature in OpenShift (and Kubernetes) that
      allows you to set resource usage limits for each kind of resource in a Namespace.
      It defines a minimum and maximum usage limit for resources that match a specific
      kind, such as CPU, memory, or storage. By setting these limits, you can ensure
      that the resources are being used efficiently and prevent any single resource-intensive
      application from consuming disproportionate amounts of the shared resources.


      In OpenShift, a LimitRange object has several parameters, including:


      1. `type`: This parameter specifies the type of resource that the LimitRange
      applies to. Common types include "cpu", "memory", and "storage".

      2. `limits`: This parameter is an array of `LimitRangeItem` objects that define
      the minimum and maximum usage limits for the resources.

      3. `defaultRequest`: This parameter specifies the default amount of CPU and
      memory that a container can request if not specified in the Pod spec.

      4. `defaultLimit`: This parameter specifies the default limit-to-request ratio
      for a container.


      By using LimitRanges, you can manage and control the resource usage in your
      OpenShift cluster, ensuring that each application gets the resources it needs
      while preventing any single application from consuming excessive resources.'

    query: What is the purpose of the Vertical Pod Autoscaler Operator in Openshift?
    expected_response: 'The Vertical Pod Autoscaler Operator (VPA) in OpenShift is
      responsible for monitoring the resource consumption of pods and determining
      the optimal CPU and memory resources for them. It consists of three components:
      a recommender, an updater, and an admission controller. The recommender determines
      the optimal resources, the updater checks if the pods have the correct resources
      and recreates them if not, and the admission controller sets the correct resource
      requests on each new pod. The VPA can be used with a default recommender or
      with an alternative recommender based on user''s requirements.'

    query: Is there a doc on updating clusters?
    expected_response: Yes, there is a document on updating clusters in Red Hat OpenShift
      Container Platform. The document provides best practices for cluster updates
      and describes the major aspects of the update process. It also includes information
      on using the Topology Aware Lifecycle Manager (TALM) to manage software lifecycle,
      performing canary rollout updates, and ensuring proper configuration of PodDisruptionBudget
      for minimizing disruptions during maintenance tasks.

    query: How do I find my clusterID?
    expected_response: 'To find your clusterID, you can follow these steps:


      1. Navigate to Home -> Overview in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
      web console.

      2. Look for the Cluster ID field in the Details section to find your cluster''s
      unique identifier.


      Alternatively, you can use the OpenShift CLI (oc) and run the following command:

      ```terminal

      $ oc get clusterversion -o jsonpath=''{.items[].spec.clusterID}{"

      "}''

      ```


      These methods will help you obtain your clusterID for reference or when providing
      information to Red Hat Support.'

    expected_response: No, I do not recommend using DeploymentConfig as of Red Hat
      OpenShift Container Platform 4.14. DeploymentConfig objects are deprecated and
      should not be used for new installations. Instead, use Deployment objects or
      another alternative to provide declarative updates for pods.
