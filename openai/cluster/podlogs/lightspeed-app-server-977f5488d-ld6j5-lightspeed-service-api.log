# Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform architecture



# Introduction to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is a platform for developing and running containerized
applications. It is designed to allow applications and the data centers
that support them to expand from just a few machines and applications to
thousands of machines that serve millions of clients.

With its foundation in Kubernetes, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform incorporates the same
technology that serves as the engine for massive telecommunications, streaming
video, gaming, banking, and other applications. Its implementation in open
Red Hat technologies lets you extend your containerized applications beyond a
single cloud to on-premise and multi-cloud environments.

## About Kubernetes

Although container images and the containers that run from them are the
primary building blocks for modern application development, to run them at scale
requires a reliable and flexible distribution system. Kubernetes is the
defacto standard for orchestrating containers.

Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration engine for automating
deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. The general
concept of Kubernetes is fairly simple:

* Start with one or more worker nodes to run the container workloads.
* Manage the deployment of those workloads from one or more control plane nodes.
* Wrap containers in a deployment unit called a pod. Using pods provides extra
metadata with the container and offers the ability to group several containers
in a single deployment entity.
* Create special kinds of assets. For example, services are represented by a
set of pods and a policy that defines how they are accessed.

Document:
containers:: Lightweight and executable images that consist of software and all of its dependencies. Because containers virtualize the operating system, you can run containers anywhere, such as data centers, public or private clouds, and local hosts.
container orchestration engine:: Software that automates the deployment, management, scaling, and networking of containers.
container workloads:: Applications that are packaged and deployed in containers.
control groups (cgroups):: Partitions sets of processes into groups to manage and limit the resources processes consume.
control plane:: A container orchestration layer that exposes the API and interfaces to define, deploy, and manage the life cycle of containers. Control planes are also known as control plane machines.
CRI-O:: A Kubernetes native container runtime implementation that integrates with the operating system to deliver an efficient Kubernetes experience.
deployment:: A Kubernetes resource object that maintains the life cycle of an application.
Dockerfile:: A text file that contains the user commands to perform on a terminal to assemble the image.
hosted control planes:: A Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform feature that enables hosting a control plane on the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster from its data plane and workers. This model performs the following actions:
* Optimize infrastructure costs required for the control planes.
* Improve the cluster creation time.
* Enable hosting the control plane using the Kubernetes native high level primitives. For example, deployments and stateful sets.
* Allow a strong network segmentation between the control plane and workloads.
hybrid cloud deployments:: Deployments that deliver a consistent platform across bare metal, virtual, private, and public cloud environments. This offers speed, agility, and portability.
Ignition:: A utility that RHCOS uses to manipulate disks during initial configuration.

# Kubernetes resources

A custom resource is an extension of the Kubernetes API. You can customize Kubernetes clusters by using custom resources. Operators are software extensions which manage applications and their components with the help of custom resources. Kubernetes uses a declarative model when you want a fixed desired result while dealing with cluster resources. By using Operators, Kubernetes defines its states in a declarative way. You can modify the Kubernetes cluster resources by using imperative commands.
An Operator acts as a control loop which continuously compares the desired state of resources with the actual state of resources and puts actions in place to bring reality in line with the desired state.

Kubernetes is a core component of an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. You can use Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform for developing and running containerized applications. With its foundation in Kubernetes, the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform incorporates the same technology that serves as the engine for massive telecommunications, streaming video, gaming, banking, and other applications. You can extend your containerized applications beyond a single cloud to on-premise and multi-cloud environments by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

![247 OpenShift Kubernetes Overview 2]

A cluster is a single computational unit consisting of multiple nodes in a cloud environment. A Kubernetes cluster includes a control plane and worker nodes. You can run Kubernetes containers across various machines and environments. The control plane node controls and maintains the state of a cluster. You can run the Kubernetes application by using worker nodes. You can use the Kubernetes namespace to differentiate cluster resources in a cluster. Namespace scoping is applicable for resource objects, such as deployment, service, and pods.

# Kubernetes overview


Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration tool developed by Google. You can run and manage container-based workloads by using Kubernetes. The most common Kubernetes use case is to deploy an array of interconnected microservices, building an application in a cloud native way. You can create Kubernetes clusters that can span hosts across on-premise, public, private, or hybrid clouds.
Traditionally, applications were deployed on top of a single operating system. With virtualization, you can split the physical host into several virtual hosts. Working on virtual instances on shared resources is not optimal for efficiency and scalability. Because a virtual machine (VM) consumes as many resources as a physical machine, providing resources to a VM such as CPU, RAM, and storage can be expensive. Also, you might see your application degrading in performance due to virtual instance usage on shared resources.
![247 OpenShift Kubernetes Overview]
To solve this problem, you can use containerization technologies that segregate applications in a containerized environment. Similar to a VM, a container has its own filesystem, vCPU, memory, process space, dependencies, and more. Containers are decoupled from the underlying infrastructure, and are portable across clouds and OS distributions. Containers are inherently much lighter than a fully-featured OS, and are lightweight isolated processes that run on the operating system kernel. VMs are slower to boot, and are an abstraction of physical hardware. VMs run on a single machine with the help of a hypervisor.
You can perform the following actions by using Kubernetes:
* Sharing resources
* Orchestrating containers across multiple hosts
* Installing new hardware configurations
* Running health checks and self-healing applications
* Scaling containerized applications

# Kubernetes components

This policy
allows containers to connect to the services that they need even if they do not
have the specific IP addresses for the services. Replication controllers are
another special asset that indicates how many pod replicas are required to run
at a time. You can use this capability to automatically scale your application
to adapt to its current demand.

In only a few years, Kubernetes has seen massive cloud and on-premise adoption.
The open source development model allows many people to extend Kubernetes
by implementing different technologies for components such as networking,
storage, and authentication.

## The benefits of containerized applications

Using containerized applications offers many advantages over using traditional deployment methods. Where applications were once expected to be installed on operating systems that included all their dependencies, containers let an application carry their dependencies with them. Creating containerized applications offers many benefits.

### Operating system benefits

Containers use small, dedicated Linux operating systems without a kernel. Their file system, networking, cgroups, process tables, and namespaces are separate from the host Linux system, but the containers can integrate with the hosts seamlessly when necessary. Being based on Linux allows containers to use all the advantages that come with the open source development model of rapid innovation.

Because each container uses a dedicated operating system, you can deploy applications that require conflicting software dependencies on the same host. Each container carries its own dependent software and manages its own interfaces, such as networking and file systems, so applications never need to compete for those assets.

### Deployment and scaling benefits

If you employ rolling upgrades between major releases of your application, you can continuously improve your applications without downtime and still maintain compatibility with the current release.

# Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform architecture



# Introduction to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is a platform for developing and running containerized
applications. It is designed to allow applications and the data centers
that support them to expand from just a few machines and applications to
thousands of machines that serve millions of clients.

With its foundation in Kubernetes, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform incorporates the same
technology that serves as the engine for massive telecommunications, streaming
video, gaming, banking, and other applications. Its implementation in open
Red Hat technologies lets you extend your containerized applications beyond a
single cloud to on-premise and multi-cloud environments.

## About Kubernetes

Although container images and the containers that run from them are the
primary building blocks for modern application development, to run them at scale
requires a reliable and flexible distribution system. Kubernetes is the
defacto standard for orchestrating containers.

Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration engine for automating
deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. The general
concept of Kubernetes is fairly simple:

* Start with one or more worker nodes to run the container workloads.
* Manage the deployment of those workloads from one or more control plane nodes.
* Wrap containers in a deployment unit called a pod. Using pods provides extra
metadata with the container and offers the ability to group several containers
in a single deployment entity.
* Create special kinds of assets. For example, services are represented by a
set of pods and a policy that defines how they are accessed.

Document:
containers:: Lightweight and executable images that consist of software and all of its dependencies. Because containers virtualize the operating system, you can run containers anywhere, such as data centers, public or private clouds, and local hosts.
container orchestration engine:: Software that automates the deployment, management, scaling, and networking of containers.
container workloads:: Applications that are packaged and deployed in containers.
control groups (cgroups):: Partitions sets of processes into groups to manage and limit the resources processes consume.
control plane:: A container orchestration layer that exposes the API and interfaces to define, deploy, and manage the life cycle of containers. Control planes are also known as control plane machines.
CRI-O:: A Kubernetes native container runtime implementation that integrates with the operating system to deliver an efficient Kubernetes experience.
deployment:: A Kubernetes resource object that maintains the life cycle of an application.
Dockerfile:: A text file that contains the user commands to perform on a terminal to assemble the image.
hosted control planes:: A Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform feature that enables hosting a control plane on the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster from its data plane and workers. This model performs the following actions:
* Optimize infrastructure costs required for the control planes.
* Improve the cluster creation time.
* Enable hosting the control plane using the Kubernetes native high level primitives. For example, deployments and stateful sets.
* Allow a strong network segmentation between the control plane and workloads.
hybrid cloud deployments:: Deployments that deliver a consistent platform across bare metal, virtual, private, and public cloud environments. This offers speed, agility, and portability.
Ignition:: A utility that RHCOS uses to manipulate disks during initial configuration.

# Kubernetes resources

A custom resource is an extension of the Kubernetes API. You can customize Kubernetes clusters by using custom resources. Operators are software extensions which manage applications and their components with the help of custom resources. Kubernetes uses a declarative model when you want a fixed desired result while dealing with cluster resources. By using Operators, Kubernetes defines its states in a declarative way. You can modify the Kubernetes cluster resources by using imperative commands.
An Operator acts as a control loop which continuously compares the desired state of resources with the actual state of resources and puts actions in place to bring reality in line with the desired state.

Kubernetes is a core component of an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. You can use Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform for developing and running containerized applications. With its foundation in Kubernetes, the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform incorporates the same technology that serves as the engine for massive telecommunications, streaming video, gaming, banking, and other applications. You can extend your containerized applications beyond a single cloud to on-premise and multi-cloud environments by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

![247 OpenShift Kubernetes Overview 2]

A cluster is a single computational unit consisting of multiple nodes in a cloud environment. A Kubernetes cluster includes a control plane and worker nodes. You can run Kubernetes containers across various machines and environments. The control plane node controls and maintains the state of a cluster. You can run the Kubernetes application by using worker nodes. You can use the Kubernetes namespace to differentiate cluster resources in a cluster. Namespace scoping is applicable for resource objects, such as deployment, service, and pods.

# Kubernetes overview


Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration tool developed by Google. You can run and manage container-based workloads by using Kubernetes. The most common Kubernetes use case is to deploy an array of interconnected microservices, building an application in a cloud native way. You can create Kubernetes clusters that can span hosts across on-premise, public, private, or hybrid clouds.
Traditionally, applications were deployed on top of a single operating system. With virtualization, you can split the physical host into several virtual hosts. Working on virtual instances on shared resources is not optimal for efficiency and scalability. Because a virtual machine (VM) consumes as many resources as a physical machine, providing resources to a VM such as CPU, RAM, and storage can be expensive. Also, you might see your application degrading in performance due to virtual instance usage on shared resources.
![247 OpenShift Kubernetes Overview]
To solve this problem, you can use containerization technologies that segregate applications in a containerized environment. Similar to a VM, a container has its own filesystem, vCPU, memory, process space, dependencies, and more. Containers are decoupled from the underlying infrastructure, and are portable across clouds and OS distributions. Containers are inherently much lighter than a fully-featured OS, and are lightweight isolated processes that run on the operating system kernel. VMs are slower to boot, and are an abstraction of physical hardware. VMs run on a single machine with the help of a hypervisor.
You can perform the following actions by using Kubernetes:
* Sharing resources
* Orchestrating containers across multiple hosts
* Installing new hardware configurations
* Running health checks and self-healing applications
* Scaling containerized applications

# Kubernetes components

Document:
This policy
allows containers to connect to the services that they need even if they do not
have the specific IP addresses for the services. Replication controllers are
another special asset that indicates how many pod replicas are required to run
at a time. You can use this capability to automatically scale your application
to adapt to its current demand.

In only a few years, Kubernetes has seen massive cloud and on-premise adoption.
The open source development model allows many people to extend Kubernetes
by implementing different technologies for components such as networking,
storage, and authentication.

## The benefits of containerized applications

Using containerized applications offers many advantages over using traditional deployment methods. Where applications were once expected to be installed on operating systems that included all their dependencies, containers let an application carry their dependencies with them. Creating containerized applications offers many benefits.

### Operating system benefits

Containers use small, dedicated Linux operating systems without a kernel. Their file system, networking, cgroups, process tables, and namespaces are separate from the host Linux system, but the containers can integrate with the hosts seamlessly when necessary. Being based on Linux allows containers to use all the advantages that come with the open source development model of rapid innovation.

Because each container uses a dedicated operating system, you can deploy applications that require conflicting software dependencies on the same host. Each container carries its own dependent software and manages its own interfaces, such as networking and file systems, so applications never need to compete for those assets.

### Deployment and scaling benefits

If you employ rolling upgrades between major releases of your application, you can continuously improve your applications without downtime and still maintain compatibility with the current release.

# About installation and updates

As a cluster administrator, you can use the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program to install and deploy a cluster by using one of the following methods:

* Installer-provisioned infrastructure
* User-provisioned infrastructure

# About the control plane

The control plane manages the worker nodes and the pods in your cluster. You can configure nodes with the use of machine config pools (MCPs).
MCPs are groups of machines, such as control plane components or user workloads, that are based on the resources that they handle.
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform assigns different roles to hosts.

private registry:: Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform can use any server implementing the container image registry API as a source of the image which allows the developers to push and pull their private container images.
public registry:: Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform can use any server implementing the container image registry API as a source of the image which allows the developers to push and pull their public container images.
RHEL Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Cluster Manager:: A managed service where you can install, modify, operate, and upgrade your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters.
RHEL Quay Container Registry:: A Quay.io container registry that serves most of the container images and Operators to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters.
replication controllers:: An asset that indicates how many pod replicas are required to run at a time.
role-based access control (RBAC):: A key security control to ensure that cluster users and workloads have only access to resources required to execute their roles.
route:: Routes expose a service to allow for network access to pods from users and applications outside the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform instance.
scaling:: The increasing or decreasing of resource capacity.
service:: A service exposes a running application on a set of pods.
Source-to-Image (S2I) image:: An image created based on the programming language of the application source code in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform to deploy applications.
storage:: Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform supports many types of storage, both for on-premise and cloud providers. You can manage container storage for persistent and non-persistent data in an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

# Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform architecture



# Introduction to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is a platform for developing and running containerized
applications. It is designed to allow applications and the data centers
that support them to expand from just a few machines and applications to
thousands of machines that serve millions of clients.

With its foundation in Kubernetes, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform incorporates the same
technology that serves as the engine for massive telecommunications, streaming
video, gaming, banking, and other applications. Its implementation in open
Red Hat technologies lets you extend your containerized applications beyond a
single cloud to on-premise and multi-cloud environments.

## About Kubernetes

Although container images and the containers that run from them are the
primary building blocks for modern application development, to run them at scale
requires a reliable and flexible distribution system. Kubernetes is the
defacto standard for orchestrating containers.

Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration engine for automating
deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. The general
concept of Kubernetes is fairly simple:

* Start with one or more worker nodes to run the container workloads.
* Manage the deployment of those workloads from one or more control plane nodes.
* Wrap containers in a deployment unit called a pod. Using pods provides extra
metadata with the container and offers the ability to group several containers
in a single deployment entity.
* Create special kinds of assets. For example, services are represented by a
set of pods and a policy that defines how they are accessed.

Document:
containers:: Lightweight and executable images that consist of software and all of its dependencies. Because containers virtualize the operating system, you can run containers anywhere, such as data centers, public or private clouds, and local hosts.
container orchestration engine:: Software that automates the deployment, management, scaling, and networking of containers.
container workloads:: Applications that are packaged and deployed in containers.
control groups (cgroups):: Partitions sets of processes into groups to manage and limit the resources processes consume.
control plane:: A container orchestration layer that exposes the API and interfaces to define, deploy, and manage the life cycle of containers. Control planes are also known as control plane machines.
CRI-O:: A Kubernetes native container runtime implementation that integrates with the operating system to deliver an efficient Kubernetes experience.
deployment:: A Kubernetes resource object that maintains the life cycle of an application.
Dockerfile:: A text file that contains the user commands to perform on a terminal to assemble the image.
hosted control planes:: A Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform feature that enables hosting a control plane on the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster from its data plane and workers. This model performs the following actions:
* Optimize infrastructure costs required for the control planes.
* Improve the cluster creation time.
* Enable hosting the control plane using the Kubernetes native high level primitives. For example, deployments and stateful sets.
* Allow a strong network segmentation between the control plane and workloads.
hybrid cloud deployments:: Deployments that deliver a consistent platform across bare metal, virtual, private, and public cloud environments. This offers speed, agility, and portability.
Ignition:: A utility that RHCOS uses to manipulate disks during initial configuration.

# Kubernetes resources

A custom resource is an extension of the Kubernetes API. You can customize Kubernetes clusters by using custom resources. Operators are software extensions which manage applications and their components with the help of custom resources. Kubernetes uses a declarative model when you want a fixed desired result while dealing with cluster resources. By using Operators, Kubernetes defines its states in a declarative way. You can modify the Kubernetes cluster resources by using imperative commands.
An Operator acts as a control loop which continuously compares the desired state of resources with the actual state of resources and puts actions in place to bring reality in line with the desired state.

Kubernetes is a core component of an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. You can use Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform for developing and running containerized applications. With its foundation in Kubernetes, the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform incorporates the same technology that serves as the engine for massive telecommunications, streaming video, gaming, banking, and other applications. You can extend your containerized applications beyond a single cloud to on-premise and multi-cloud environments by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

![247 OpenShift Kubernetes Overview 2]

A cluster is a single computational unit consisting of multiple nodes in a cloud environment. A Kubernetes cluster includes a control plane and worker nodes. You can run Kubernetes containers across various machines and environments. The control plane node controls and maintains the state of a cluster. You can run the Kubernetes application by using worker nodes. You can use the Kubernetes namespace to differentiate cluster resources in a cluster. Namespace scoping is applicable for resource objects, such as deployment, service, and pods.

# Kubernetes overview


Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration tool developed by Google. You can run and manage container-based workloads by using Kubernetes. The most common Kubernetes use case is to deploy an array of interconnected microservices, building an application in a cloud native way. You can create Kubernetes clusters that can span hosts across on-premise, public, private, or hybrid clouds.
Traditionally, applications were deployed on top of a single operating system. With virtualization, you can split the physical host into several virtual hosts. Working on virtual instances on shared resources is not optimal for efficiency and scalability. Because a virtual machine (VM) consumes as many resources as a physical machine, providing resources to a VM such as CPU, RAM, and storage can be expensive. Also, you might see your application degrading in performance due to virtual instance usage on shared resources.
![247 OpenShift Kubernetes Overview]
To solve this problem, you can use containerization technologies that segregate applications in a containerized environment. Similar to a VM, a container has its own filesystem, vCPU, memory, process space, dependencies, and more. Containers are decoupled from the underlying infrastructure, and are portable across clouds and OS distributions. Containers are inherently much lighter than a fully-featured OS, and are lightweight isolated processes that run on the operating system kernel. VMs are slower to boot, and are an abstraction of physical hardware. VMs run on a single machine with the help of a hypervisor.
You can perform the following actions by using Kubernetes:
* Sharing resources
* Orchestrating containers across multiple hosts
* Installing new hardware configurations
* Running health checks and self-healing applications
* Scaling containerized applications

# Kubernetes components

Document:
This policy
allows containers to connect to the services that they need even if they do not
have the specific IP addresses for the services. Replication controllers are
another special asset that indicates how many pod replicas are required to run
at a time. You can use this capability to automatically scale your application
to adapt to its current demand.

In only a few years, Kubernetes has seen massive cloud and on-premise adoption.
The open source development model allows many people to extend Kubernetes
by implementing different technologies for components such as networking,
storage, and authentication.

## The benefits of containerized applications

Using containerized applications offers many advantages over using traditional deployment methods. Where applications were once expected to be installed on operating systems that included all their dependencies, containers let an application carry their dependencies with them. Creating containerized applications offers many benefits.

### Operating system benefits

Containers use small, dedicated Linux operating systems without a kernel. Their file system, networking, cgroups, process tables, and namespaces are separate from the host Linux system, but the containers can integrate with the hosts seamlessly when necessary. Being based on Linux allows containers to use all the advantages that come with the open source development model of rapid innovation.

Because each container uses a dedicated operating system, you can deploy applications that require conflicting software dependencies on the same host. Each container carries its own dependent software and manages its own interfaces, such as networking and file systems, so applications never need to compete for those assets.

### Deployment and scaling benefits

If you employ rolling upgrades between major releases of your application, you can continuously improve your applications without downtime and still maintain compatibility with the current release.

Learn about OpenShift Virtualization's capabilities and support scope.

# What you can do with OpenShift Virtualization

OpenShift Virtualization is an add-on to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform that allows you to run and manage virtual machine workloads alongside container workloads.

OpenShift Virtualization adds new objects into your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster by using Kubernetes custom resources to enable virtualization tasks. These tasks include:

* Creating and managing Linux and Windows virtual machines (VMs)
* Running pod and VM workloads alongside each other in a cluster
* Connecting to virtual machines through a variety of consoles and CLI tools
* Importing and cloning existing virtual machines
* Managing network interface controllers and storage disks attached to virtual machines
* Live migrating virtual machines between nodes

An enhanced web console provides a graphical portal to manage these virtualized resources alongside the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster containers and infrastructure.

OpenShift Virtualization is designed and tested to work well with Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation features.


[IMPORTANT]
----
When you deploy OpenShift Virtualization with OpenShift Data Foundation, you must create a dedicated storage class for Windows virtual machine disks. See Optimizing ODF PersistentVolumes for Windows VMs for details.
----

You can use OpenShift Virtualization with OVN-Kubernetes, OpenShift SDN, or one of the other certified network plugins listed in Certified OpenShift CNI Plug-ins.

You can check your OpenShift Virtualization cluster for compliance issues by installing the Compliance Operator and running a scan with the ocp4-moderate and ocp4-moderate-node profiles.

# Quick starts

Quick start tours are available for several OpenShift Virtualization features. To view the tours, click the Help icon ? in the menu bar on the header of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console and then select Quick Starts. You can filter the available tours by entering the keyword virtualization in the Filter field.

# New and changed features

This release adds new features and enhancements related to the following components and concepts:

## Installation and update

* After upgrading to OpenShift Virtualization 4.16, data volumes that were previously removed through garbage collection might be recreated. This behavior is expected. You can ignore the recreated data volumes because data volume garbage collection is now disabled.

## Virtualization

* Windows 10 VMs now boot using UEFI with TPM.

* Enabling the AutoResourceLimits feature gate automatically manages CPU and memory limits of a VM.
* The KubeVirt Tekton tasks are now shipped as a part of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Pipelines catalog.

## Networking

* You can now access a VM that is connected to the default internal pod network on a stable fully qualified domain name (FQDN) by using headless services.

## Web console

* Hot plugging virtual machines is now generally available. If a virtual machine cannot be hot plugged, the condition RestartRequired is applied to the VM.

# Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform overview


Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is a cloud-based Kubernetes container platform. The foundation of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is based on Kubernetes and therefore shares the same technology. It is designed to allow applications and the data centers that support them to expand from just a few machines and applications to thousands of machines that serve millions of clients.
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform enables you to do the following:
* Provide developers and IT organizations with cloud application platforms that can be used for deploying applications on secure and scalable resources.
* Require minimal configuration and management overhead.
* Bring the Kubernetes platform to customer data centers and cloud.
* Meet security, privacy, compliance, and governance requirements.
With its foundation in Kubernetes, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform incorporates the same technology that serves as the engine for massive telecommunications, streaming video, gaming, banking, and other applications. Its implementation in open Red Hat technologies lets you extend your containerized applications beyond a single cloud to on-premise and multi-cloud environments.

# Glossary of common terms for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

This glossary defines common Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform terms.

Kubernetes:: Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration engine for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
Containers:: Containers are application instances and components that run in OCI-compliant containers on the worker nodes. A container is the runtime of an Open Container Initiative (OCI)-compliant image. An image is a binary application. A worker node can run many containers. A node capacity is related to memory and CPU capabilities of the underlying resources whether they are cloud, hardware, or virtualized.

# DeploymentConfig [apps.openshift.io/v1]


Description:: 
Deployment Configs define the template for a pod and manages deploying new images or configuration changes. A single deployment configuration is usually analogous to a single micro-service. Can support many different deployment patterns, including full restart, customizable rolling updates, and  fully custom behaviors, as well as pre- and post- deployment hooks. Each individual deployment is represented as a replication controller.
A deployment is "triggered" when its configuration is changed or a tag in an Image Stream is changed. Triggers can be disabled to allow manual control over a deployment. The "strategy" determines how the deployment is carried out and may be changed at any time. The latestVersion field is updated when a new deployment is triggered by any means.
Compatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer). Deprecated: Use deployments or other means for declarative updates for pods instead.

# DeploymentConfig objects


[IMPORTANT]
----
As of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14, DeploymentConfig objects are deprecated. DeploymentConfig objects are still supported, but are not recommended for new installations. Only security-related and critical issues will be fixed.
Instead, use Deployment objects or another alternative to provide declarative updates for pods.
----

Building on replication controllers, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform adds expanded support for the software development and deployment lifecycle with the concept of DeploymentConfig objects. In the simplest case, a DeploymentConfig object creates a new replication controller and lets it start up pods.

However, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform deployments from DeploymentConfig objects also provide the ability to transition from an existing deployment of an image to a new one and also define hooks to be run before or after creating the replication controller.

The DeploymentConfig deployment system provides the following capabilities:

* A DeploymentConfig object, which is a template for running applications.
* Triggers that drive automated deployments in response to events.
* User-customizable deployment strategies to transition from the previous version to the new version. A strategy runs inside a pod commonly referred as the deployment process.

Document:
# Using deployment strategies


Deployment strategies are used to change or upgrade applications without downtime so that users barely notice a change.
Because users generally access applications through a route handled by a router, deployment strategies can focus on DeploymentConfig object features or routing features. Strategies that focus on DeploymentConfig object features impact all routes that use the application. Strategies that use router features target individual routes.
Most deployment strategies are supported through the DeploymentConfig object, and some additional strategies are supported through router features.

# Choosing a deployment strategy

Consider the following when choosing a deployment strategy:

* Long-running connections must be handled gracefully.
* Database conversions can be complex and must be done and rolled back along with the application.
* If the application is a hybrid of microservices and traditional components, downtime might be required to complete the transition.
* You must have the infrastructure to do this.
* If you have a non-isolated test environment, you can break both new and old versions.

A deployment strategy uses readiness checks to determine if a new pod is ready for use. If a readiness check fails, the DeploymentConfig object retries to run the pod until it times out. The default timeout is 10m, a value set in TimeoutSeconds in dc.spec.strategy.*params.

# Rolling strategy

A rolling deployment slowly replaces instances of the previous version of an application with instances of the new version of the application. The rolling strategy is the default deployment strategy used if no strategy is specified on a DeploymentConfig object.

A rolling deployment typically waits for new pods to become ready via a readiness check before scaling down the old components. If a significant issue occurs, the rolling deployment can be aborted.

Document:
When to use a rolling deployment:

* When you want to take no downtime during an application update.
* When your application supports having old code and new code running at the same time.

A rolling deployment means you have both old and new versions of your code running at the same time. This typically requires that your application handle N-1 compatibility.

# Ingress Operator in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform



# Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Ingress Operator

When you create your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, pods and services running on the cluster are each allocated their own IP addresses. The IP addresses are accessible to other pods and services running nearby but are not accessible to outside clients. The Ingress Operator implements the IngressController API and is the component responsible for enabling external access to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster services.

The Ingress Operator makes it possible for external clients to access your service by deploying and managing one or more HAProxy-based
Ingress Controllers to handle routing. You can use the Ingress Operator to route traffic by specifying Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Route and Kubernetes Ingress resources. Configurations within the Ingress Controller, such as the ability to define endpointPublishingStrategy type and internal load balancing, provide ways to publish Ingress Controller endpoints.

# The Ingress configuration asset

The installation program generates an asset with an Ingress resource in the config.openshift.io API group, cluster-ingress-02-config.yml.


```yaml
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  domain: apps.openshiftdemos.com
```

Document:
The most common way to manage Ingress traffic is with the Ingress Controller. You can scale and replicate this pod like any other regular pod. This router service is based on HAProxy, which is an open source load balancer solution.

The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform route provides Ingress traffic to services in the cluster. Routes provide advanced features that might not be supported by standard Kubernetes Ingress Controllers, such as TLS re-encryption, TLS passthrough, and split traffic for blue-green deployments.

Ingress traffic accesses services in the cluster through a route. Routes and Ingress are the main resources for handling Ingress traffic. Ingress provides features similar to a route, such as accepting external requests and delegating them based on the route. However, with Ingress you can only allow certain types of connections: HTTP/2, HTTPS and server name identification (SNI), and TLS with certificate. In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, routes are generated to meet the conditions specified by the Ingress resource.

# Glossary of common terms for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform networking

This glossary defines common terms that are used in the networking content.

authentication:: To control access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, a cluster administrator can configure user authentication and ensure only approved users access the cluster. To interact with an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, you must authenticate to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform API. You can authenticate by providing an OAuth access token or an X.509 client certificate in your requests to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform API.

Document:
If the service is deleted and recreated, a new IP address can be
assigned to the service, and requires the front-end pods to be recreated to pick
up the updated values for the service IP environment variable. Additionally, the
back-end service must be created before any of the front-end pods to ensure that
the service IP is generated properly, and that it can be provided to the
front-end pods as an environment variable.

For this reason, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform has a built-in DNS so that the services can be
reached by the service DNS as well as the service IP/port.

## Comparing routes and Ingress

The Kubernetes Ingress resource in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform implements the Ingress Controller with a shared router service that runs as a pod inside the cluster.

Document:
Ingress:: The Kubernetes Ingress resource in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform implements the Ingress Controller with a shared router service that runs as a pod inside the cluster.
Ingress Controller:: The Ingress Operator manages Ingress Controllers. Using an Ingress Controller is the most common way to allow external access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
installer-provisioned infrastructure:: The installation program deploys and configures the infrastructure that the cluster runs on.
kubelet:: A primary node agent that runs on each node in the cluster to ensure that containers are running in a pod.
Kubernetes NMState Operator:: The Kubernetes NMState Operator provides a Kubernetes API for performing state-driven network configuration across the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster’s nodes with NMState.
kube-proxy:: Kube-proxy is a proxy service which runs on each node and helps in making services available to the external host. It helps in forwarding the request to correct containers and is capable of performing primitive load balancing.
load balancers:: Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform uses load balancers for communicating from outside the cluster with services running in the cluster.
MetalLB Operator:: As a cluster administrator, you can add the MetalLB Operator to your cluster so that when a service of type LoadBalancer is added to the cluster, MetalLB can add an external IP address for the service.
multicast:: With IP multicast, data is broadcast to many IP addresses simultaneously.
namespaces:: A namespace isolates specific system resources that are visible to all processes. Inside a namespace, only processes that are members of that namespace can see those resources.
networking:: Network information of a Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

Human: what is ingress in kubernetes?
AI: In Kubernetes, Ingress is a collection of rules that allow inbound connections to reach the endpoints defined by a backend. It can be configured to give services externally-reachable URLs, load balance traffic, terminate SSL, offer name-based virtual hosting, and more. Ingress helps manage external access to services in a Kubernetes cluster.

# Introduction to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is a platform for developing and running containerized
applications. It is designed to allow applications and the data centers
that support them to expand from just a few machines and applications to
thousands of machines that serve millions of clients.

With its foundation in Kubernetes, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform incorporates the same
technology that serves as the engine for massive telecommunications, streaming
video, gaming, banking, and other applications. Its implementation in open
Red Hat technologies lets you extend your containerized applications beyond a
single cloud to on-premise and multi-cloud environments.

![Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes Engine]

## About Kubernetes

Although container images and the containers that run from them are the
primary building blocks for modern application development, to run them at scale
requires a reliable and flexible distribution system. Kubernetes is the
defacto standard for orchestrating containers.

Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration engine for automating
deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. The general
concept of Kubernetes is fairly simple:

* Start with one or more worker nodes to run the container workloads.
* Manage the deployment of those workloads from one or more control plane nodes.
* Wrap containers in a deployment unit called a pod. Using pods provides extra
metadata with the container and offers the ability to group several containers
in a single deployment entity.
* Create special kinds of assets. For example, services are represented by a
set of pods and a policy that defines how they are accessed.

# Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform overview


Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is a cloud-based Kubernetes container platform. The foundation of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is based on Kubernetes and therefore shares the same technology. It is designed to allow applications and the data centers that support them to expand from just a few machines and applications to thousands of machines that serve millions of clients.
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform enables you to do the following:
* Provide developers and IT organizations with cloud application platforms that can be used for deploying applications on secure and scalable resources.
* Require minimal configuration and management overhead.
* Bring the Kubernetes platform to customer data centers and cloud.
* Meet security, privacy, compliance, and governance requirements.
With its foundation in Kubernetes, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform incorporates the same technology that serves as the engine for massive telecommunications, streaming video, gaming, banking, and other applications. Its implementation in open Red Hat technologies lets you extend your containerized applications beyond a single cloud to on-premise and multi-cloud environments.

# Glossary of common terms for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

This glossary defines common Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform terms.

Kubernetes:: Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration engine for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
Containers:: Containers are application instances and components that run in OCI-compliant containers on the worker nodes. A container is the runtime of an Open Container Initiative (OCI)-compliant image. An image is a binary application. A worker node can run many containers. A node capacity is related to memory and CPU capabilities of the underlying resources whether they are cloud, hardware, or virtualized.

Document:
Although Kubernetes excels at managing your applications, it does not specify or manage platform-level requirements or deployment processes. Powerful and flexible platform management tools and processes are important benefits that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform offers. You must add authentication, networking, security, monitoring, and logs management to your containerization platform.

Document:
containers:: Lightweight and executable images that consist of software and all of its dependencies. Because containers virtualize the operating system, you can run containers anywhere, such as data centers, public or private clouds, and local hosts.
container orchestration engine:: Software that automates the deployment, management, scaling, and networking of containers.
container workloads:: Applications that are packaged and deployed in containers.
control groups (cgroups):: Partitions sets of processes into groups to manage and limit the resources processes consume.
control plane:: A container orchestration layer that exposes the API and interfaces to define, deploy, and manage the life cycle of containers. Control planes are also known as control plane machines.
CRI-O:: A Kubernetes native container runtime implementation that integrates with the operating system to deliver an efficient Kubernetes experience.
deployment:: A Kubernetes resource object that maintains the life cycle of an application.
Dockerfile:: A text file that contains the user commands to perform on a terminal to assemble the image.
hosted control planes:: A Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform feature that enables hosting a control plane on the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster from its data plane and workers. This model performs the following actions:
* Optimize infrastructure costs required for the control planes.
* Improve the cluster creation time.
* Enable hosting the control plane using the Kubernetes native high level primitives. For example, deployments and stateful sets.
* Allow a strong network segmentation between the control plane and workloads.
hybrid cloud deployments:: Deployments that deliver a consistent platform across bare metal, virtual, private, and public cloud environments. This offers speed, agility, and portability.
Ignition:: A utility that RHCOS uses to manipulate disks during initial configuration.

Document:
It completes common disk tasks, including partitioning disks, formatting partitions, writing files, and configuring users.
installer-provisioned infrastructure:: The installation program deploys and configures the infrastructure that the cluster runs on.
kubelet:: A primary node agent that runs on each node in the cluster to ensure that containers are running in a pod.
kubernetes manifest:: Specifications of a Kubernetes API object in a JSON or YAML format. A configuration file can include deployments, config maps, secrets, daemon sets.
Machine Config Daemon (MCD):: A daemon that regularly checks the nodes for configuration drift.
Machine Config Operator (MCO):: An Operator that applies the new configuration to your cluster machines.
machine config pools (MCP):: A group of machines, such as control plane components or user workloads, that are based on the resources that they handle.
metadata:: Additional information about cluster deployment artifacts.
microservices:: An approach to writing software. Applications can be separated into the smallest components, independent from each other by using microservices.
mirror registry:: A registry that holds the mirror of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform images.
monolithic applications:: Applications that are self-contained, built, and packaged as a single piece.
namespaces:: A namespace isolates specific system resources that are visible to all processes. Inside a namespace, only processes that are members of that namespace can see those resources.
networking:: Network information of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
node:: A worker machine in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. A node is either a virtual machine (VM) or a physical machine.
OpenShift CLI (oc):: A command line tool to run Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform commands on the terminal.

# Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform architecture



# Introduction to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is a platform for developing and running containerized
applications. It is designed to allow applications and the data centers
that support them to expand from just a few machines and applications to
thousands of machines that serve millions of clients.

With its foundation in Kubernetes, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform incorporates the same
technology that serves as the engine for massive telecommunications, streaming
video, gaming, banking, and other applications. Its implementation in open
Red Hat technologies lets you extend your containerized applications beyond a
single cloud to on-premise and multi-cloud environments.

## About Kubernetes

Although container images and the containers that run from them are the
primary building blocks for modern application development, to run them at scale
requires a reliable and flexible distribution system. Kubernetes is the
defacto standard for orchestrating containers.

Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration engine for automating
deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. The general
concept of Kubernetes is fairly simple:

* Start with one or more worker nodes to run the container workloads.
* Manage the deployment of those workloads from one or more control plane nodes.
* Wrap containers in a deployment unit called a pod. Using pods provides extra
metadata with the container and offers the ability to group several containers
in a single deployment entity.
* Create special kinds of assets. For example, services are represented by a
set of pods and a policy that defines how they are accessed.

Document:
containers:: Lightweight and executable images that consist of software and all of its dependencies. Because containers virtualize the operating system, you can run containers anywhere, such as data centers, public or private clouds, and local hosts.
container orchestration engine:: Software that automates the deployment, management, scaling, and networking of containers.
container workloads:: Applications that are packaged and deployed in containers.
control groups (cgroups):: Partitions sets of processes into groups to manage and limit the resources processes consume.
control plane:: A container orchestration layer that exposes the API and interfaces to define, deploy, and manage the life cycle of containers. Control planes are also known as control plane machines.
CRI-O:: A Kubernetes native container runtime implementation that integrates with the operating system to deliver an efficient Kubernetes experience.
deployment:: A Kubernetes resource object that maintains the life cycle of an application.
Dockerfile:: A text file that contains the user commands to perform on a terminal to assemble the image.
hosted control planes:: A Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform feature that enables hosting a control plane on the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster from its data plane and workers. This model performs the following actions:
* Optimize infrastructure costs required for the control planes.
* Improve the cluster creation time.
* Enable hosting the control plane using the Kubernetes native high level primitives. For example, deployments and stateful sets.
* Allow a strong network segmentation between the control plane and workloads.
hybrid cloud deployments:: Deployments that deliver a consistent platform across bare metal, virtual, private, and public cloud environments. This offers speed, agility, and portability.
Ignition:: A utility that RHCOS uses to manipulate disks during initial configuration.

# Kubernetes resources

A custom resource is an extension of the Kubernetes API. You can customize Kubernetes clusters by using custom resources. Operators are software extensions which manage applications and their components with the help of custom resources. Kubernetes uses a declarative model when you want a fixed desired result while dealing with cluster resources. By using Operators, Kubernetes defines its states in a declarative way. You can modify the Kubernetes cluster resources by using imperative commands.
An Operator acts as a control loop which continuously compares the desired state of resources with the actual state of resources and puts actions in place to bring reality in line with the desired state.

Kubernetes is a core component of an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. You can use Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform for developing and running containerized applications. With its foundation in Kubernetes, the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform incorporates the same technology that serves as the engine for massive telecommunications, streaming video, gaming, banking, and other applications. You can extend your containerized applications beyond a single cloud to on-premise and multi-cloud environments by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

![247 OpenShift Kubernetes Overview 2]

A cluster is a single computational unit consisting of multiple nodes in a cloud environment. A Kubernetes cluster includes a control plane and worker nodes. You can run Kubernetes containers across various machines and environments. The control plane node controls and maintains the state of a cluster. You can run the Kubernetes application by using worker nodes. You can use the Kubernetes namespace to differentiate cluster resources in a cluster. Namespace scoping is applicable for resource objects, such as deployment, service, and pods.

# Kubernetes overview


Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration tool developed by Google. You can run and manage container-based workloads by using Kubernetes. The most common Kubernetes use case is to deploy an array of interconnected microservices, building an application in a cloud native way. You can create Kubernetes clusters that can span hosts across on-premise, public, private, or hybrid clouds.
Traditionally, applications were deployed on top of a single operating system. With virtualization, you can split the physical host into several virtual hosts. Working on virtual instances on shared resources is not optimal for efficiency and scalability. Because a virtual machine (VM) consumes as many resources as a physical machine, providing resources to a VM such as CPU, RAM, and storage can be expensive. Also, you might see your application degrading in performance due to virtual instance usage on shared resources.
![247 OpenShift Kubernetes Overview]
To solve this problem, you can use containerization technologies that segregate applications in a containerized environment. Similar to a VM, a container has its own filesystem, vCPU, memory, process space, dependencies, and more. Containers are decoupled from the underlying infrastructure, and are portable across clouds and OS distributions. Containers are inherently much lighter than a fully-featured OS, and are lightweight isolated processes that run on the operating system kernel. VMs are slower to boot, and are an abstraction of physical hardware. VMs run on a single machine with the help of a hypervisor.
You can perform the following actions by using Kubernetes:
* Sharing resources
* Orchestrating containers across multiple hosts
* Installing new hardware configurations
* Running health checks and self-healing applications
* Scaling containerized applications

# Kubernetes components

Document:
This policy
allows containers to connect to the services that they need even if they do not
have the specific IP addresses for the services. Replication controllers are
another special asset that indicates how many pod replicas are required to run
at a time. You can use this capability to automatically scale your application
to adapt to its current demand.

In only a few years, Kubernetes has seen massive cloud and on-premise adoption.
The open source development model allows many people to extend Kubernetes
by implementing different technologies for components such as networking,
storage, and authentication.

## The benefits of containerized applications

Using containerized applications offers many advantages over using traditional deployment methods. Where applications were once expected to be installed on operating systems that included all their dependencies, containers let an application carry their dependencies with them. Creating containerized applications offers many benefits.

### Operating system benefits

Containers use small, dedicated Linux operating systems without a kernel. Their file system, networking, cgroups, process tables, and namespaces are separate from the host Linux system, but the containers can integrate with the hosts seamlessly when necessary. Being based on Linux allows containers to use all the advantages that come with the open source development model of rapid innovation.

Because each container uses a dedicated operating system, you can deploy applications that require conflicting software dependencies on the same host. Each container carries its own dependent software and manages its own interfaces, such as networking and file systems, so applications never need to compete for those assets.

### Deployment and scaling benefits

If you employ rolling upgrades between major releases of your application, you can continuously improve your applications without downtime and still maintain compatibility with the current release.

# Introduction to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is a platform for developing and running containerized
applications. It is designed to allow applications and the data centers
that support them to expand from just a few machines and applications to
thousands of machines that serve millions of clients.

With its foundation in Kubernetes, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform incorporates the same
technology that serves as the engine for massive telecommunications, streaming
video, gaming, banking, and other applications. Its implementation in open
Red Hat technologies lets you extend your containerized applications beyond a
single cloud to on-premise and multi-cloud environments.

![Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes Engine]

## About Kubernetes

Although container images and the containers that run from them are the
primary building blocks for modern application development, to run them at scale
requires a reliable and flexible distribution system. Kubernetes is the
defacto standard for orchestrating containers.

Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration engine for automating
deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. The general
concept of Kubernetes is fairly simple:

* Start with one or more worker nodes to run the container workloads.
* Manage the deployment of those workloads from one or more control plane nodes.
* Wrap containers in a deployment unit called a pod. Using pods provides extra
metadata with the container and offers the ability to group several containers
in a single deployment entity.
* Create special kinds of assets. For example, services are represented by a
set of pods and a policy that defines how they are accessed.

# Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform overview


Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is a cloud-based Kubernetes container platform. The foundation of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is based on Kubernetes and therefore shares the same technology. It is designed to allow applications and the data centers that support them to expand from just a few machines and applications to thousands of machines that serve millions of clients.
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform enables you to do the following:
* Provide developers and IT organizations with cloud application platforms that can be used for deploying applications on secure and scalable resources.
* Require minimal configuration and management overhead.
* Bring the Kubernetes platform to customer data centers and cloud.
* Meet security, privacy, compliance, and governance requirements.
With its foundation in Kubernetes, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform incorporates the same technology that serves as the engine for massive telecommunications, streaming video, gaming, banking, and other applications. Its implementation in open Red Hat technologies lets you extend your containerized applications beyond a single cloud to on-premise and multi-cloud environments.

# Glossary of common terms for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

This glossary defines common Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform terms.

Kubernetes:: Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration engine for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
Containers:: Containers are application instances and components that run in OCI-compliant containers on the worker nodes. A container is the runtime of an Open Container Initiative (OCI)-compliant image. An image is a binary application. A worker node can run many containers. A node capacity is related to memory and CPU capabilities of the underlying resources whether they are cloud, hardware, or virtualized.

Document:
Although Kubernetes excels at managing your applications, it does not specify or manage platform-level requirements or deployment processes. Powerful and flexible platform management tools and processes are important benefits that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform offers. You must add authentication, networking, security, monitoring, and logs management to your containerization platform.

Document:
containers:: Lightweight and executable images that consist of software and all of its dependencies. Because containers virtualize the operating system, you can run containers anywhere, such as data centers, public or private clouds, and local hosts.
container orchestration engine:: Software that automates the deployment, management, scaling, and networking of containers.
container workloads:: Applications that are packaged and deployed in containers.
control groups (cgroups):: Partitions sets of processes into groups to manage and limit the resources processes consume.
control plane:: A container orchestration layer that exposes the API and interfaces to define, deploy, and manage the life cycle of containers. Control planes are also known as control plane machines.
CRI-O:: A Kubernetes native container runtime implementation that integrates with the operating system to deliver an efficient Kubernetes experience.
deployment:: A Kubernetes resource object that maintains the life cycle of an application.
Dockerfile:: A text file that contains the user commands to perform on a terminal to assemble the image.
hosted control planes:: A Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform feature that enables hosting a control plane on the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster from its data plane and workers. This model performs the following actions:
* Optimize infrastructure costs required for the control planes.
* Improve the cluster creation time.
* Enable hosting the control plane using the Kubernetes native high level primitives. For example, deployments and stateful sets.
* Allow a strong network segmentation between the control plane and workloads.
hybrid cloud deployments:: Deployments that deliver a consistent platform across bare metal, virtual, private, and public cloud environments. This offers speed, agility, and portability.
Ignition:: A utility that RHCOS uses to manipulate disks during initial configuration.

Document:
It completes common disk tasks, including partitioning disks, formatting partitions, writing files, and configuring users.
installer-provisioned infrastructure:: The installation program deploys and configures the infrastructure that the cluster runs on.
kubelet:: A primary node agent that runs on each node in the cluster to ensure that containers are running in a pod.
kubernetes manifest:: Specifications of a Kubernetes API object in a JSON or YAML format. A configuration file can include deployments, config maps, secrets, daemon sets.
Machine Config Daemon (MCD):: A daemon that regularly checks the nodes for configuration drift.
Machine Config Operator (MCO):: An Operator that applies the new configuration to your cluster machines.
machine config pools (MCP):: A group of machines, such as control plane components or user workloads, that are based on the resources that they handle.
metadata:: Additional information about cluster deployment artifacts.
microservices:: An approach to writing software. Applications can be separated into the smallest components, independent from each other by using microservices.
mirror registry:: A registry that holds the mirror of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform images.
monolithic applications:: Applications that are self-contained, built, and packaged as a single piece.
namespaces:: A namespace isolates specific system resources that are visible to all processes. Inside a namespace, only processes that are members of that namespace can see those resources.
networking:: Network information of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
node:: A worker machine in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. A node is either a virtual machine (VM) or a physical machine.
OpenShift CLI (oc):: A command line tool to run Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform commands on the terminal.

# Introduction to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is a platform for developing and running containerized
applications. It is designed to allow applications and the data centers
that support them to expand from just a few machines and applications to
thousands of machines that serve millions of clients.

With its foundation in Kubernetes, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform incorporates the same
technology that serves as the engine for massive telecommunications, streaming
video, gaming, banking, and other applications. Its implementation in open
Red Hat technologies lets you extend your containerized applications beyond a
single cloud to on-premise and multi-cloud environments.

## About Kubernetes

Although container images and the containers that run from them are the
primary building blocks for modern application development, to run them at scale
requires a reliable and flexible distribution system. Kubernetes is the
defacto standard for orchestrating containers.

Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration engine for automating
deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. The general
concept of Kubernetes is fairly simple:

* Start with one or more worker nodes to run the container workloads.
* Manage the deployment of those workloads from one or more control plane nodes.
* Wrap containers in a deployment unit called a pod. Using pods provides extra
metadata with the container and offers the ability to group several containers
in a single deployment entity.
* Create special kinds of assets. For example, services are represented by a
set of pods and a policy that defines how they are accessed.

Document:
Although Kubernetes excels at managing your applications, it does not specify or manage platform-level requirements or deployment processes. Powerful and flexible platform management tools and processes are important benefits that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform offers. You must add authentication, networking, security, monitoring, and logs management to your containerization platform.

# Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform overview


Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is a cloud-based Kubernetes container platform. The foundation of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is based on Kubernetes and therefore shares the same technology. It is designed to allow applications and the data centers that support them to expand from just a few machines and applications to thousands of machines that serve millions of clients.
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform enables you to do the following:
* Provide developers and IT organizations with cloud application platforms that can be used for deploying applications on secure and scalable resources.
* Require minimal configuration and management overhead.
* Bring the Kubernetes platform to customer data centers and cloud.
* Meet security, privacy, compliance, and governance requirements.
With its foundation in Kubernetes, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform incorporates the same technology that serves as the engine for massive telecommunications, streaming video, gaming, banking, and other applications. Its implementation in open Red Hat technologies lets you extend your containerized applications beyond a single cloud to on-premise and multi-cloud environments.

# Glossary of common terms for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

This glossary defines common Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform terms.

Kubernetes:: Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration engine for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
Containers:: Containers are application instances and components that run in OCI-compliant containers on the worker nodes. A container is the runtime of an Open Container Initiative (OCI)-compliant image. An image is a binary application. A worker node can run many containers. A node capacity is related to memory and CPU capabilities of the underlying resources whether they are cloud, hardware, or virtualized.

Document:
It completes common disk tasks, including partitioning disks, formatting partitions, writing files, and configuring users.
installer-provisioned infrastructure:: The installation program deploys and configures the infrastructure that the cluster runs on.
kubelet:: A primary node agent that runs on each node in the cluster to ensure that containers are running in a pod.
kubernetes manifest:: Specifications of a Kubernetes API object in a JSON or YAML format. A configuration file can include deployments, config maps, secrets, daemon sets.
Machine Config Daemon (MCD):: A daemon that regularly checks the nodes for configuration drift.
Machine Config Operator (MCO):: An Operator that applies the new configuration to your cluster machines.
machine config pools (MCP):: A group of machines, such as control plane components or user workloads, that are based on the resources that they handle.
metadata:: Additional information about cluster deployment artifacts.
microservices:: An approach to writing software. Applications can be separated into the smallest components, independent from each other by using microservices.
mirror registry:: A registry that holds the mirror of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform images.
monolithic applications:: Applications that are self-contained, built, and packaged as a single piece.
namespaces:: A namespace isolates specific system resources that are visible to all processes. Inside a namespace, only processes that are members of that namespace can see those resources.
networking:: Network information of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
node:: A worker machine in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. A node is either a virtual machine (VM) or a physical machine.
OpenShift CLI (oc):: A command line tool to run Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform commands on the terminal.

Document:
containers:: Lightweight and executable images that consist of software and all of its dependencies. Because containers virtualize the operating system, you can run containers anywhere, such as data centers, public or private clouds, and local hosts.
container orchestration engine:: Software that automates the deployment, management, scaling, and networking of containers.
container workloads:: Applications that are packaged and deployed in containers.
control groups (cgroups):: Partitions sets of processes into groups to manage and limit the resources processes consume.
control plane:: A container orchestration layer that exposes the API and interfaces to define, deploy, and manage the life cycle of containers. Control planes are also known as control plane machines.
CRI-O:: A Kubernetes native container runtime implementation that integrates with the operating system to deliver an efficient Kubernetes experience.
deployment:: A Kubernetes resource object that maintains the life cycle of an application.
Dockerfile:: A text file that contains the user commands to perform on a terminal to assemble the image.
hosted control planes:: A Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform feature that enables hosting a control plane on the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster from its data plane and workers. This model performs the following actions:
* Optimize infrastructure costs required for the control planes.
* Improve the cluster creation time.
* Enable hosting the control plane using the Kubernetes native high level primitives. For example, deployments and stateful sets.
* Allow a strong network segmentation between the control plane and workloads.
hybrid cloud deployments:: Deployments that deliver a consistent platform across bare metal, virtual, private, and public cloud environments. This offers speed, agility, and portability.
Ignition:: A utility that RHCOS uses to manipulate disks during initial configuration.
